# Mindat Data Collector
 
This is a simple little NodeJS tool I threw together to show how to use the Mindat API to repeatedly grab pages of info from mindat to copy an entire database locally.

For this one I used the page 'https://api.mindat.org/geomaterials/'

Visit the page while logged in to view more information / get filters / view the database.

You can change the filters and functionality in the index.js file.
